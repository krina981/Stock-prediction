# Stock-prediction
Welcome to our stock prediction project, where we harness the power of machine learning to forecast stock prices and make informed investment decisions. Our repository contains a collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data files that enable you to explore various machine learning models for predicting stock prices accurately.
Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: We provide comprehensive data preprocessing scripts to clean, normalize, and handle missing data, ensuring that the models receive high-quality input.
Feature Engineering: Our feature engineering techniques help extract meaningful insights from the financial data and create powerful predictors for stock price movements.
Machine Learning Models: Explore an assortment of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and more.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models with various metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared (R2) to identify the best-performing model.
Model Comparison: Compare different models side by side to understand their strengths and weaknesses in stock prediction.
Forecasting: Utilize our trained models to predict future stock prices, visualize the predictions, and gain valuable insights.
Interactive Visualizations: We provide interactive plots and visualizations to help you interpret the model outputs effectively.
Real-Time Data Support: We demonstrate how to fetch real-time stock data using APIs and feed it to the models for live predictions.
Whether you are a beginner in machine learning or an experienced data scientist, our repository offers valuable resources to enhance your knowledge in stock market prediction using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We encourage contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the open-source community to continually improve the models and share new ideas.
